## Description
A Mindfulness App for Goal Setting
> One Reason is a mindfulness app that encourages the user to log in once a day, even if only for just a moment, to check in on their goals.  The user can set as many goals as they would like, and each day the user lists one reason why they are working towards their goal.

> Users must log in to access the app content.  New users are prompted to create a profile and set their first goal on authentication

> The landing page for existing users prompts them to enter their reason for the day and displays historical posts below.  The user can elect to post their reason under their name or anonymously.  Historical posts on the home page can be filtered by related goal.

> The feed page displays all reasons for all users. Users can like posts that they identify with or to give support, and may filter the feed by posts they have liked. Posts celebrating a goal met use special formatting to stand out.

> The goals and journal pages are private to the user.  The user can review, edit, and delete their goals.  When a goal is marked as met, the user is given the option to share in a public post.  The journal gives the user space for more in depth contemplation than their daily reason post, and will not display to the feed.
