    "body": "Journaling became a natural extension of the One Reason exercise for me, as a way to expand on daily mindfulness.  In the beginning, listing your reasons is easy, but with time you have to think a little deeper to come up with something new.  Journalling encourages you to further explore those thoughts and take time with your intentions.  For me journaling is not about documenting and I have little interest in going back to read old entries.  I'm not writing stories, just taking time to be intentional.  I could just as easily set a timer and just decide to think about my goal for a set amount of time, but honestly that feels like a weird thing to do.  Writing is just a tool for channeling my thoughts and keeping on task. I'll leave the stories to the bloggers.",

    "body": "Following through on my goals has never been my strength.  In college I came upon a thread in a chat forum called 'I will stay on plan today because...'  It as my first exposure to this type of daily mindfulness exercise.  In WW culture, you see references to this practice with #100ReasonsWhy and 'What's your Why?' branded merchandise.  Listing one reason per day why you wish to work toward your goals is a powerful first step in mindfulness.  It is a quick task, which makes it easier to commit to.  But it requires you to acknowledge your goal every single day, which reduces your inclination to back burner it in your priority list.  I chose this as a topic for my app, to take this powerful exercise beyond weight loss culture and apply it to the motivation and goal setting realm in general.",
